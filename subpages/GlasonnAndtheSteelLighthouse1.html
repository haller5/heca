</head><body class="c9 doc-content"><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Chapter One.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How much longer will the summer be?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Uhm..&rdquo; he laid out the tablecloth below his legs, placing the delicate china and tea. &ldquo;I believe soon. Within the coming weeks, if I am to recall correctly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do we not have some&hellip;&rdquo; Drinking the tea, he searched around the room. It was made of a thick steel&mdash; the walls. Large windows were scattered around, though the night was black against the sky, with only the dotted milky array of stars forming any light against it. &ldquo;Some, oh you know, some calendar&mdash; it slipped my mind. Do we have one?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir, no we do not.&rdquo; He paced around the room, carrying a napkin on his forearm. His long boots tapped against the wooden floor as he walked toward the door. Opening the great steel door, held closed by a mechanical contraption, he departed, before popping in briefly: &ldquo;You had torn them all.&rdquo; He left.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He had torn them all, yes. He remembered. Though not why. Stuck in the labyrinth of steel, in an entirely remote area, he was on a rather small and aloof island, surrounded only by the strong ocean. He sat in silence, with the silent sough of the sea filling his ears, though muffled by the steel walls.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How much longer will the summer be?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;How much longer will the summer be?&rdquo; He pulled at his collared shirt as he began to sweat. The room which he sat in, legs up on the table, was garishly lit with a bright white lamp hung from the ceiling, made to be reminiscent of a traditional chandelier, though it had more the silhouette of a jungle of industrial pipes, from which spherical electrical bulbs dangled, swinging lightly. He put his cup down, standing up. Walking around, in boots and all, he pulled off his tie placing it down on the large velvet couch near him. His face flushed and his ears burned red as he walked around, large wooden closets dug into the walls, he walked around, circling the table, looking out through the windows as he held his head in place, the room swirling quickly about him in a glowing blur of light. He dug at his eyes, he held his hair, covering his ears before falling against the window.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Drussock! Drussock, I&rsquo;ve fallen! I&rsquo;ve fallen ill! God, this heat! Drussock, please!&rdquo; Glason&rsquo;n held onto the window sill, frigid, heaving himself upward and opening the window. Heavy, large brumal winds cascaded through the opening, pushing him back with strong force. His hair was being swept along the motion of the wind, his nose and ears were mottled in red as the cold scraped at his face.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Drussock came through the door, hastily making his way toward Glason&rsquo;n who was near fallen over, but sat on his knees.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir Glason&rsquo;n! Sir, what happened? What happened, Sir?&rdquo; He held Glason&rsquo;n and laid him onto the ground. &ldquo;Oh, stay here for a moment, do not move!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He went out and came back with a towel, drenched in cold water, and placed it on Glason&rsquo;n&rsquo;s brow. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said with a whisper, &ldquo;what did you do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;I tell you, Drussock! This heat, it is this </span><span class="c3">heat!</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but I am burning! I feel so sick.&rdquo; He took a deep breath and his gaze was lost in the steel beams running across the ceiling. &ldquo;I think I must take a step outside.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir, please do not. The tide is incredibly strong at night, and it&rsquo;s much too incredibly dark as well. We&rsquo;ve not even charted a fraction of the island. You&rsquo;ve no idea how dangerous it is. And, though hot in here, it is freezing out there, as the winds are bitterly cold, I tell you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Drussock, don&rsquo;t stop me. And regardless, the island is quite small, isn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;ll have no problem, I promise. I may seem to be in no shape, but if you make any attempts to stop me, I will have to simply fight you to get outside.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Drussock sighed, looking closely at Glason&rsquo;n. Glason&rsquo;n didn&rsquo;t look back, but seemed lost in thought. Drussock laughed as he stood up. &ldquo;Do as you will, sir. I&rsquo;ve no desire to stop you.&rdquo; Glason&rsquo;n smiled as Drussock left the room. He had forgotten to close the window. The chandelier swung more violently through the night.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glason&rsquo;n did not step out immediately. He fell asleep. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A few hours had passed before he was awake again. The room was still bright; the window was still open, too. He was laid against the wooden floor, near the large mosaic rug. He sat up and tucked his woollen trousers into his polished leather boots. Standing up, he reached toward the closet nearest him. He pulled a matching overcoat and tightened a belt over the waist&rsquo;s straps. He looked out through the window, before closing it. On his way out he grabbed his Inverness cape from a large black aluminium stand against the wall near the door, along with his cane which was a dark navy colour. Walking down the hallway, he noticed the relative cool air which brushed through the tight corridor. The walls were steel as well, with the floor being a carpeted floor with abstract post-modern cubist art. It was a striking beige against the grey walls. He made his way down the spiral stairway, from which many corridors extended at the various floors. Descending the long flight of stairs left him lethargic and he began to notice his feeling resembling that of a feverous dream. His steps felt a little too light to be his and his cane dragged behind his steps. Reaching the bottom he searched for a bathroom, desperately. He was in the large living room near the entrance. Large pillars towered and romanesque architecture made the room seem like a dreadfully tasteless chamber. He scampered along the lurid carpeted floor and velveted furniture over through to the bathroom on the far end. Taking his towel in hand, he ran it under the cold water, soaking it entirely, before placing it on his forehead, underneath his hair. He held his chin slightly pointed upward as he searched the drawers and cabinets for some gauze dressings to keep it in place. As he did so, he began to listen to the surrounding, as the main chamber grew alive in whispers of music. He stayed silent, crouched against the cabinets, listening closely, as he heard orchestra through the walls, only in the very distance, though it had a strong presence, as it seemed to emanate from the walls themselves and not some singular source, not some radio or other device. Slowing down, he reached into one of the lower cabinets, keeping his gaze out toward the entrance to the restroom, as his fingers grazed upon what he perceived to be bandages. He pulled them close and applied them to the towel&mdash; wrapped haphazardly across his head and covering his right eye&mdash; to keep it in place. He looked in the mirror in front of him and patted his hair down against his ears and listened intently.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c5">What is that sound? Surely it can&rsquo;t be Drussock! It is late&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He sauntered along the marble floors, carefully stepping so as not to make great noise with his boots. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Drussock! Drussock! What is with this whisper I hear?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cold streams of water seeped from the towel, running down his cheeks and nose. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Drussock!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Are you playing any music?&rdquo; He called out from within the bathroom, with only a slight crack of light slipping through the bathroom door which was left fractionally ajar. &ldquo;Druss&hellip;&rdquo; Meandering aimlessly in a sort of relaxed motion, he circled the various furniture and quarters of the main chamber, following the sound which appeared to have no source, whispering back at him in the same volume from each end of the room. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">What could this be? But if not my imagination, then it must&hellip; it must be my imagination? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He decided to continue with his objective of stepping outside and directed his gaze toward the daunting wooden door, shut with golden locks and chains. Walking on the heels of his boots to prevent any loud noises, he reached the door. At the entrance, where the carpeted floor ended and switched to a dark wood, he saw his large steel helmet. Shaped in a peculiar blend of steel and aluminium, it was a roughly moulded spherical shape, rusted on its sides and with one large circular opening for the left eye, where the right eye was welded shut. It was an old prisoner&rsquo;s iron mask, used for those condemned to life sentences. As such, made for humiliative purposes, the helmet was adorned with a wooden crown of thorns, fastened into place by welded rings of iron which held the wood in place. Though for him, he made great use of it many times. He found it long ago, when he first arrived here, in the lower basement chamber of the lighthouse. The entire room had naught but the lonely helmet. He used it for the strong, biting winter winds, though it really was not winter, he thought. It was summer. Midsummer, maybe. But this close to the sea it seemed the seasons truly did not matter when it came to the night. He wore the helmet and stepped outside. It was completely dark as he spitter-spattered down the steps in a sort of tap dance rhythm, though of course he wasn&rsquo;t dancing, but was really tapping at the rhythm of his hesitancy, lilting up and down the flight of stairs. If not for his timid sound&mdash; awfully resounding as the steps were steel&mdash; the surrounding forest of trees had near fallen to a total lull, with only the occasional bird chirping here and there. The flight of stairs was a singular set, though on the second landing it split into two, going in opposite diagonal directions, with a large bronze statue of a man, aloof and inquisitive toward the ground, sat against nothing. Glason&rsquo;n hurried past the statue, paying it no mind but a glance, enough to see that the bronze was quite new, really. It was not weathered in the slightest, which left him with a similarly inquisitive gesture upon his face as he descended. His cane banged against the steps and his cape caught the wind. He was a rattle of trinkets and other curios, military medals and golden discs, silver flags and arrows, chains and locks, all attached to his coat and cape in helpless hazardous ways. Reaching the foot of the stairs he stopped suddenly. The music was much quieter now, too; though&mdash; suspiciously&mdash; he still heard it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It is quite cold, he thought. The wind was very cold and very strong, and though the moonlight was obscured by thick clouds, his iron helmet glinted shyly. He trodded onward through the thicket, passing against brambles and rabbits which hid within them. He could hear the silent scurry of rustling leaves and bouncing steps as small animals fled from his steps. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I wonder how large the island is?&rdquo; he whispered to himself. &ldquo;Drussock had told me there had been no maps of the place when we arrived. Still, I find that&hellip;&rdquo; He glanced back at the steel lighthouse structure. It had a funny silhouette, nothing like that of an old lighthouse. It was far too strange, with hallways jutting out, floating parts which one could only wonder for eternity how they were held up without any support. It&rsquo;s silhouette was more like that of a very large gnarled tree. A tree made of thick steel pipes, circular or rectangular. It ran with steam&mdash; that is, a boiler deep within the lower chambers of the lighthouse; below the ground. It powered the entire building. From the back, near the left of the building, smoke could be seen billowing from a chimney which ran along its side walls. He could see his room toward the top, radiantly apparent, with an enamel glow from the window now closed. &ldquo;Still, I find that to be a little odd, if not ridiculous. Truly, Drussock may have not looked.&rdquo; </span></p></body></html>
